Heat the skillet over medium heat and put the bread slices over the skillet putting the potato mixture side down.
Let it cook for about 2-3 minutes or till it is golden brown from bottom. Note: if you turn too quickly the spread will start coming out. Turn it over; put one slice of cheese and tomato slices covering the bread slice.
